# E-commerce Padaria Progresso

* The "Padaria Progresso" project had its origins as an integrative project during my web development technical course.
* It was conceived as a website for a bakery, incorporating features of a shopping cart system, orders that would be forwarded to WhatsApp, as well as home and product detail screens.
* Essentially, the project constitutes an e-commerce platform tailored for a bakery, with the main technologies employed being CRUD, PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* The website's structure enables users to explore the bakery's product catalog, add items to their shopping cart, and complete their orders.
* Orders are efficiently forwarded to WhatsApp, simplifying and streamlining the purchasing process.
